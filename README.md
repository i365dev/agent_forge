# AgentForge

## Description

AgentForge is a powerful and flexible signal-driven workflow framework designed for building intelligent, dynamic, and adaptive systems. With "signal flow" as its core abstraction, AgentForge enables the construction of complex workflows through composable handler chains and persistent state management, making sophisticated systems simpler and more elegant to build. What makes AgentForge unique is its ability to support AI-driven dynamic workflow creation, allowing systems to adapt execution paths in real-time based on environmental changes and new information.

### Core Design Philosophy

- **Signal-Driven Architecture**: All interactions are modeled as flows and transformations of signals
- **State Persistence**: Maintain context and working state across processing steps
- **Composable Handlers**: Build complex behaviors by combining simple handlers
- **Primitives System**: Provide powerful primitives for expressing complex logic and control flows
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Support runtime workflow creation and adjustment

### Key Features

- **High Abstraction**: Unified interface for handling various types of signals and data
- **Unlimited Extensibility**: Easy addition of new handlers, signal types, and integration points
- **Intelligent Decision Making**: Support for AI-driven branching decisions and path discovery
- **Expressive Power**: Primitives system supporting conditional logic, loops, and transformations
- **Fault Isolation**: Handler isolation design prevents cascading failures
- **Optimized Performance**: High concurrency processing capabilities based on Elixir/OTP

### Application Scenarios

AgentForge transcends traditional workflow engines, suitable for a wide range of scenarios requiring intelligence and adaptability:

- **Intelligent Conversation Systems**: Build conversational agents that dynamically adjust to user needs
- **Market Monitoring Systems**: Create adaptive event monitoring and analysis pipelines
- **Information Processing Bots**: Develop flexible, configurable information collection and processing systems
- **Research Analysis Tools**: Implement multi-step, adaptive data analysis workflows
- **Automated Decision Systems**: Build systems that can make autonomous decisions based on changing environments
- **Task Orchestration Platforms**: Support intelligent orchestration of complex, multi-stage tasks
- **Smart Learning Systems**: Develop educational systems that dynamically adjust based on learning progress

### Distinction from Traditional Workflow Engines

Traditional workflow engines are based on predefined paths and fixed decision points, whereas AgentForge allows workflows themselves to evolve and adapt at runtime. This paradigm shift enables systems to handle unforeseen situations and discover innovative solutions, rather than being limited to paths envisioned by designers.

AgentForge's core abstractions (signals, handlers, stores, flows) combined with its primitives system provide an ideal foundation for building the next generation of intelligent systems.

## Usage

### Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `agent_forge` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:agent_forge, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
